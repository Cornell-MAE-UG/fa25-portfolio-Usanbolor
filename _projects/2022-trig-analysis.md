This year, as part of my Formula Racing Project team, I am responsible for designing, manufacturing, and testing the steering system. Our steering system is a rack-and-pinion setup, which converts the rotational motion of the steering wheel into the linear motion of the rack, enabling the front wheels to turn left and right.

A well-designed steering system must not only provide precise directional control but also remain lightweight, structurally sound, and free of excessive play. Our main goal this year is to optimize the component designs for both weight and rigidity, while ensuring that mountings are positioned with adequate clearance from other systems, such as the suspension. During the previous competition, judges specifically noted issues with our lower constraint mounting.

My focus is on creating a steering system design that is lightweight, compliant with competition rules, rigid, and minimizes slop, while maintaining optimal performance under dynamic driving conditions. Below I will talk about some of the challenges we have faced and how I solved those problems:
