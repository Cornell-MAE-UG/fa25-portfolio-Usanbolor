Last year, I was part designer in the Ergonomics subteam at Cornell Racing, focusing on the design of the steering wheel. The integration of electronic components has significantly influenced both the design and manufacturing processes. As a result, my role involves developing a steering wheel that is lightweight, rigid, ergonomic, and capable of supporting electronic integration.

**Introduction**
Steering wheel gives the driver direct control over the car, enabling them to steer left or right through its connection to the steering system and the front wheels. Without it, the car would only be capable of moving in a straight line with no directional control. An ergonomically well-designed steering wheel helps reduce arm fatigue and discomfort, which can enhance driver performance over longer periods. The integration of new buttons and dials further improves control efficiency, allowing the driver to make critical adjustments without distraction. Additionally, by targeting a lighter design, even small reductions in mass contribute positively to overall vehicle performance—lighter cars accelerate faster.
