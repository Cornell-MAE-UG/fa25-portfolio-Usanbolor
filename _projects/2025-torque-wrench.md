title: Torque Wrench Design
description: Created a detailed CAD model of a torque wrench in Fusion 360 and conducted finite element analysis in ANSYS to assess structural integrity, stress concentrations, and load-bearing performance.

For MAE3270 (Materials), we were tasked with designing a non-ratcheting, 3/8-inch drive instrumented torque wrench rated for 600 in-lbf. The wrench was to be strain-gauged, with sensors bonded to high-strain regions on the outer surface. Our analysis included analytical hand calculations supported by MATLAB, as well as finite element simulations to evaluate stress distribution, strain behavior, and overall structural performance.
