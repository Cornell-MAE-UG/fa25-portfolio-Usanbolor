## About Me

Hi! My name is Usanbolor Amartuvshin, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student with a passion for design, research, and hands-on problem-solving. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through thoughtful design and practical execution, whether it’s developing components, analyzing performance, or improving system efficiency.

As part of my university’s Formula Student project team, I’ve gained valuable experience in mechanical system design, teamwork, and creative problem-solving under tight performance constraints. Alongside this, my research on thermal inductive materials has deepened my understanding of how material properties influence efficiency and reliability in engineering applications.

I’m eager to continue expanding my technical skills and contribute to projects that integrate hands-on design with analytical thinking to develop efficient, innovative, and reliable engineering solutions.
